# LoRaSim_MABs
This repository contains an open-source LoRa simulator with applied multi-armed bandit algorithms written in C.
The bandit algorithms aim to optimize the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) and the energy consumption of the nodes in a LoRa network, by selecting the spreading factor (SF) and the transmitting power (TP) of each transmission.
Refer to te file "readme.txt" in the repository to run the experiments.
