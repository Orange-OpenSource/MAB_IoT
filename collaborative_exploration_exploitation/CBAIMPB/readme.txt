To run the simulations, follow the following steps:
1- add the file "param.txt" and "result" in the program's arguments
2- change the parameters in the param.txt file:
    a- "Algorithm": specifies the exploration algorithm: 1 LUCB
    b-"comm": specifie if communication is available between players
    c- "K": number of arms
    d- "T": time horizon of the exploitation phase
    e- "delta", "epsilon", "eta": corresponds to the exploration phase
    f- "Draws": number of repetitions of the experiment
    g- "N": number of players
    h- "p1", "pN", "col": corresponds to the players' distributions
    i- "TimeDisplay", "verbose": corresponds to the display issues
    j- "reset": specifies if one player can vote more than once
3- after the simulation ends the results are extracted to text files including: sample complexity and duration and communication cost
during the exploration phase, and the external and internal collision rates, the mean reward achieved, the progress of the successful communication rate and the fairness level.
